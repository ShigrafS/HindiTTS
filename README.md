## Introduction
TTS technology converts written text into spoken words, making it useful in various applications such as virtual assistants, audiobooks, and accessibility tools. This project aims to enhance a pre-trained TTS model's performance by fine-tuning it on a specific dataset.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: [Specify the dataset source, e.g., LibriSpeech, VoxCeleb, etc.]
- **Content**: 
  - Total audio duration: [X hours]
  - Number of speakers: [X]
  - Types of speech: [e.g., scripted, conversational]
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Normalization of audio levels
  - Segmentation into shorter clips
  - Tokenization of text data

## Model Architecture
This project utilizes the [Model Name] architecture, which is a state-of-the-art TTS model. The model was fine-tuned from the pre-trained version available in [Model Repository or Library, e.g., Hugging Face].

### Key Features

## Audio Samples
Listen to samples generated by both the pre-trained and fine-tuned models:
- **Pre-trained Model**: [Link or description of the audio sample]
- **Fine-tuned Model**: [Link or description of the audio sample]

## Installation
To set up the environment, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use the model via pipeline, run the following code:

```python
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-to-audio", model="ShigrafS/hindi_text_to_speech_tts")
```
